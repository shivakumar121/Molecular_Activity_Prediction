### 1) Load libraries
First we'll load all the required libraries and data.

```{r}
library ("caret")
library ("dplyr")
library(keras)
library (readr)
library (tensorflow)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
